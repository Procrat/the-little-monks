      <h2>Ferrell</h2>
      <div class="monk-desc">Ferrell is the self-proclaimed leader of the little monks.He has a tendency towards dictatorial leadership. Though most of the monks don't like him as a leader, no one has the guts to openly challenge him. He's an egocentric asshole that cannot manage to see the point of view of others. He is addicted to power and so he fears to lose it one day. He is kind of paranoia towards others that might be better leaders than he is. Which is pretty much everyone but he fails to see that due to his narsistic disposition.</div>

      <h2>Sally</h2>
      <div class="monk-desc">Sally is very smart, no one doubts that. But she is the kind of smart that is socially and emotionally awkward. She does not realize monks have feelings, because he does not have any, and is prone to hurt other monks because she is sure she is right. She is the right hand of Ferrell, she is the real leader, the one behind all crazy ideas. But, sssht, do not tell Ferrell!</div>
